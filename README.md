1.	Introduction:
This report aims to elucidate the purpose of the application HISTORY APP, providing a comprehensive overview of its functionality, its design considerations, and the utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions.
2.	Application Overview:
HISTORY APP is a mobile application, it allows everybody who when to check if their ages are the same ages with the ages of historical person when they pass away.
3.	Purpose of the application:
HISTORY APP designed to compare two ages, one age of historical person with another age of the users. 
    * The user must enter an age and that age must be in the range of 20 and 100.
    * If the age of the user is not between the range, the application is going to display a message to tell the user that the age is not in the range and prompt the user to enter a correct age.
    * If the user enters an age that is not in the list of the historical person ages code in the application, the HISTORY APP is going to display a not match message.
    * If the user enters an age that is in the list of the historical person code in the application, the HISTORY APP is going to display a match message. 

4.	Functionalities of the application:

	* The Input allows the user to enter an age. 
    * The output displays the message. 
    * Clear button clears the input and the display message.

5.	The design consideration
A design consideration plays a pivotal role in shaping the user experience and overall usability of the application. User interface designing (UI) designing an intuitive and visually appealing interface that enhances user interaction.

6.	The utilization of GITHUB and GITHUB Actions
GitHub serves as a central repository for the application's source code, facilitating collaborative development and version control.
    * Definition: GitHub is a web site enables developers to host all their applications codebase and it is allowing us to collaborate, share code, and track changes codebase.
    * Version control: GITHUB enables developers to track changes to the codebase, manage different versions, and collaborate seamlessly with team members through features.
    * Collaboration: GITHUB facilitates collaboration among developers by providing tools for issue tracking, project boards, and teams management, allowing communication and coordination
    * Definition: GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
    * Workflow automate: GitHub Actions allows developers to automate various tasks, such as code formatting, testing, and deployment, through custom workflows defined in YAML configuration files. GitHub Actions enable developers to build their applications with ease.

7.	Conclusion
In conclusion, this report has provided a comprehensive overview of the purpose of the application, its design considerations, and the utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions.
